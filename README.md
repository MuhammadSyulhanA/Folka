# Folka

An interactive Indonesian folklore storytelling application for children.

We want to create an immersive storytelling experience for children through mini games that are tailored according to the storyline, for example: helping the character find his way back home. 

Children are also invited to join the character's journey and choose their path that would create different endings. 

And to bring the story to life, we use animations on characters and objects for the children to interact with that will be shown shortly in our app demo.

## Installing

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/MuhammadSyulhanA/Folka.git

```

## Running iOS simulator

Make sure you've created a simulator if the simulator option does not appear. It can be found in Simulator -> Add additional simulators.

There will be 2 tabs namely devices and simulator, select a simulator then many options will appear and adjust the device you want to add. 

Follow the next process until it's finished and the simulator is ready to use.
